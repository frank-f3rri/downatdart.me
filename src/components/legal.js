                  compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
                  where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
                  arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission
                  of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
                  decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
                  reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must
                  follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
                  arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by
                  the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration
                  will take place in Wake, North Carolina. Except as otherwise
                  provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
                  arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
                  confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered
                  by the arbitrator.

                  privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive
                  relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or

                  Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to

                exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
                shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
                Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We

                damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our

                unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
